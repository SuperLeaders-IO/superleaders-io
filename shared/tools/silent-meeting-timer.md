# Protocol: The Silent Meeting Timer

> "We stop talking so we can start thinking."

## The Logic

When we switch to "Parallel Processing" (Silent Meeting mode), the silence can
be awkward on Zoom. Use this simple protocol to hold the container.

## The Script

1. **"Stop."** (Active interruption of the flow).
2. **"We are going into the Repo."**
3. **"5 Minutes on the clock. Cameras STAY ON. Microphones OFF."**
4. **"If you finish early, read the commits of the person below you on the
   screen manifest."**

## The Timer

(If you have a CLI timer tool configured) `timer 5m "Thinking Time"`

## The Return

Do not ask "Who wants to share?" Instead, look at the Commit Log. _"I see [Name]
just pushed a thought about X. [Name], take us off mute."_
