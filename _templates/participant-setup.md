# Participant Setup Guide

Welcome to the **Agentic Leadership** repository. This is your workspace.

## 1. Create Your Folder

1. Navigate to the `participants/` directory.
2. Create a new folder using your initials (e.g., `participants/JD/`).
3. Inside your folder, create a `README.md` file.

## 2. Your First Commit

In your `README.md`, introduce yourself briefly:

- **Who:** Your name and context.
- **Why:** One question you are holding right now.

## 3. How to Use This Space

- **Notes:** Keep your personal session notes here.
- **Reflections:** Add your "one-sentence" drops after each session.
- **Experiments:** Store prompts, outputs, or drafts you want to keep.

This folder is yours. Use it to think.
