# Cohort Participant Groupings

This document outlines the pairing and grouping of the cohort participants based on their professional backgrounds, aimed at maximizing cross-pollination of skills and perspectives.

**Note:** With the addition of Kunal and Franco, the cohort size is now 7. The grouping structure has been adjusted to two pairs and one triad to ensure everyone is included in a meaningful exchange.

## Group 1: The Executive Superintendents (The "System Leaders")
**Members:**
*   **Iranetta Rayborn Wright** (Superintendent, Turnaround Expert)
*   **Dr. Michael Conner** (Superintendent, Disruptive Innovation)

**Rationale:**
Both members have extensive experience leading large urban school districts but approach leadership from complementary angles. Ms. Wright excels in operational stabilization, equity, and turnaround. Dr. Conner focuses on "Disruptive Excellence" and analytics.

**Discussion Prompt:**
> "Dr. Conner, you advocate for **'Disruptive Excellence'** to force evolution in systems. Ms. Wright, you specialize in the intense stability required for **'School Turnaround'**.
>
> **Question:** How do you introduce 'disruptive' innovations into a system that is currently fighting for its basic survival? Discuss the precise balance between *stabilizing the ship* and *rocking the boat*."

## Group 2: The Service & Operations Pair (The "Stabilizers")
**Members:**
*   **Nicole Long** (Healthcare VP, Ops & Customer Success)
*   **Pam Holt** (Healthcare CEO, Empathy & Well-being)

**Rationale:**
This pairs the **Structure** (Nicole) with the **Humanity** (Pam). Both work in the high-stakes environment of healthcare but pull different levers: operational rigor vs. human well-being.

**Discussion Prompt:**
> "Nicole's work focuses on **Operational Excellence/Efficiency** and scaling structures. Pam's work focuses on **Empathy/Well-being** and the human condition.
>
> **Question:** In systems obsessed with metrics, 'Efficiency' and 'Empathy' are often seen as enemies. **How can you use Nicole's operational frameworks to actually SCALE Pam's empathy training?** How do we ensure the 'process' doesn't kill the 'person'?"

## Group 3: The Growth & Integration Triad (The "Connectors")
**Members:**
*   **Bryan McCorkle** (EdTech VP, Partnerships & Integration)
*   **Kunal** (Wildcard/Expansion)
*   **Franco** (Wildcard/Expansion)

**Rationale:**
Bryan brings deep experience in **Sustainable Integration** and partnerships. Kunal and Franco bring fresh perspectives and the potential for expansion (Wildcards). This group is tasked with exploring how to integrate new ideas/people into existing ecosystems without causing rejection.

**Discussion Prompt:**
> "Bryan's expertise is in the **Sustainable Integration** of technology—making sure new tools actually stick. Kunal and Franco represent the **New Energy/Wildcards**.
>
> **Question:** Most new initiatives fail because the 'host organism' rejects them. **How do we design an 'Integration Strategy' for Kunal and Franco's ideas that ensures long-term adoption rather than a quick flash and burnout?** What specific lessons from Bryan's partnership work apply here?"
