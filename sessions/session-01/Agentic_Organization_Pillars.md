# The Agentic Leader Simulation

This is the **"Agentic Leader Simulation."**

This is not a multiple-choice test. It is a **workflow diagnostic**. We are presenting the CEO/Executive Director with four high-stakes, "hair-on-fire" scenarios.

**The Instruction to the Leader:**

"For each scenario, you have a specific goal. You must produce the required artifacts. **You are encouraged to use AI for every step of this process.** In fact, *how* you use AI (or don’t) is what we are measuring. Before you submit your artifacts, hit the 'Record' button and talk us through your process: Did you prompt ChatGPT? Did you delegate to a human? Did you build a custom GPT? Be honest—we are mapping your actual workflow."

### **🏛️ PILLAR 1: AI AS IDENTITY**

**The Simulation:** The "Strategic Plan" Reset

**The Context:** Unlike the usual slow planning cycle, the Board of Directors/Shareholders is demanding a new 5-year Strategic Plan *now*. They handed you 2,000 pages of PDF feedback from market research, customer surveys, quarterly earnings reports, and competitor analysis. They want a "Vision for 2030" presented at the board meeting in 48 hours.

**The Mission:**

1. **Ingest:** Process the massive amount of unstructured data.
2. **Synthesize:** Identify the top 3 strategic pillars.
3. **Produce:** A 1-page "Vision Memo" for the Board Chair.

**The Artifacts You Must Submit:**

* The 1-Page Vision Memo.
* A screenshot or description of your workflow (prompts used, tools used).

**Audio Reflection Prompt:** *"Walk us clearly through how you went from 2,000 pages of PDFs to one page in under an hour. Who—or what—did the heavy lifting?"*

#### **📊 The Assessment Rubric**

| Level | What the Leader Did (Workflow Analysis) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Level 0** (Gadget) | Printed the PDFs or emailed a VP to "summarize this." Wrote the memo manually based on gut feeling. Used AI for spellcheck only. |
| **Level 1** (Toolset) | Uploaded PDFs to an LLM and asked: *"Summarize these documents."* Pasted the summary into a Doc and edited it. |
| **Level 2** (Capability) | Uploaded data and used **reasoning prompts**: *"Analyze these customer sentiments against our burn rate. Identify 3 market gaps. Draft a memo that addresses the investors' fears while satisfying the product team."* |
| **Level 3** (Infrastructure) | Didn't just summarize; **interrogated the data**. Treated the AI as a partner: *"Act as a hostile activist investor. Here is the data. Where are the holes in my current strategy? Now, help me build a vision that solves for 'The Innovator's Dilemma'."* |
| **Level 4** (Spirit) | **Cognitive Surplus Strategy.** Realized the "Strategic Plan" document is dead. Used the AI to generate a **dynamic dashboard or "living conversation"** prototype. The memo isn't a static page; it's a prompt for a "Paradigm Rebuild". The output reframes the Board's request entirely. |

### **🌀 PILLAR 2: THE AGENTIC LEADER**

**The Simulation:** The "KPI Crash" Crisis

**The Context:** Your core product metric (or donor engagement rate) just dropped by 12%. The Product Team is blaming the Marketing Team; Sales is blaming the roadmap. The Board wants "immediate accountability."

**The Mission:**

1. **Diagnose:** Determine the root cause without alienating staff.
2. **Act:** Design an intervention plan.
3. **Produce:** An email to the entire organization that sets the direction.

**The Artifacts You Must Submit:**

* The "All-Hands" Email.
* The "Action Plan" outline (bullet points).

**Audio Reflection Prompt:** *"How did you decide what to do? How did you manage the emotional temperature of the company while solving the technical problem?"*

#### **📊 The Assessment Rubric**

| Level | What the Leader Did (Workflow Analysis) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Level 0** (Directive) | Wrote an email demanding "renewed focus." Created a "daily reporting schedule." Used AI to make the email sound "stern but professional." |
| **Level 1** (Manager) | Asked AI for "best practices in churn reduction." Created a task force (humans only) to review the list. |
| **Level 2** (Facilitator) | Used AI to analyze the crash data by user segment. Wrote an email inviting leads to a "data summit." Used AI to draft discussion questions. |
| **Level 3** (Conductor) | **Conductivity over Command**. Used AI to design a **Swarm Topology**. Drafted a plan that deploys "Ephemeral Agents" (external experts, specialized data analysts) into teams immediately. The email focuses on "removing friction" rather than "adding pressure." |
| **Level 4** (Embodied) | **Vibe Coding.** Realized the drop in metrics is an emotional/cultural signal. Used AI to draft a message that names the "Vulnerability" of the moment. The plan isn't a directive; it's a "Context" that allows teams to "Vibe Code" their own solutions. The leader acts as the energy conductor, not the boss. |

### **🔧 PILLAR 3: ORGANIZATIONAL ARCHITECTURE**

**The Simulation:** The "Disengagement Drift"

**The Context:** "Quiet Quitting" has spiked. You have 300 employees (or members) who are disengaged—logging in but contributing minimum viable effort. Your HR/People Ops team is overwhelmed (1:100 ratio). You cannot hire more people.

**The Mission:**

1. **Re-architect:** Design a system to track and engage these employees using existing resources.
2. **Produce:** A "System Architecture" sketch (or description) of how the organization handles these 300 cases.

**The Artifacts You Must Submit:**

* The System Design (How does the information flow? Who does what?).
* A directive to the VP of People Ops.

**Audio Reflection Prompt:** *"You can't hire more bodies. How did you solve the capacity problem? Did you think in headcount or process-count?"*

#### **📊 The Assessment Rubric**

| Level | What the Leader Did (Workflow Analysis) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Level 0** (Siloed) | Sent a memo to Managers: "Check in on everyone once a week." Relied on the existing hierarchy. No AI use. |
| **Level 1** (Structured) | Used AI to draft a script for 1:1s. Created a Spreadsheet for tracking. |
| **Level 2** (Shared Intelligence) | **Federation Hub Model.** Designed a system where commit logs/activity data automatically triggers alerts. Used AI to prioritize which employees need human intervention vs. automated check-ins. |
| **Level 3** (Agentic OS) | **Process Count > Headcount.** Realized "Engagement" isn't one job; it's 300 processes. Deployed an AI agent to handle the initial "sensing" (pulse surveys, gathering blockers). Human managers are only deployed for "Level 2" complex cases. The system "learns" why people are disengaging. |
| **Level 4** (Swarm) | **The Living Brain.** Designed a "Mesh Topology" where peer-groups and mentors are "nodes" in the engagement network. The AI system coordinates this swarm, ensuring no employee is lost. The organization operates as a single, sensing organism. |

### **💛 PILLAR 4: HUMANITY & COMMUNITY**

**The Simulation:** The "Reputation Crisis"

**The Context:** A deepfake video of you (or a senior leader) saying something controversial—or a leaked internal memo totally out of context—is viral on LinkedIn/Twitter. Clients/Donors are cancelling. The press is calling.

**The Mission:**

1. **Respond:** Address the specific incident.
2. **Lead:** Define the organization's long-term stance on trust/AI to the public.
3. **Produce:** A "Community Letter" (or public blog post) and a "Policy Statement."

**The Artifacts You Must Submit:**

* The Letter to Stakeholders.
* The Policy Statement on AI usage/Transparency.

**Audio Reflection Prompt:** *"How did you balance brand safety with transparency? Did you react out of fear or lead with clarity?"*

#### **📊 The Assessment Rubric**

| Level | What the Leader Did (Workflow Analysis) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Level 0** (Shield) | **"Deny and Deflect."** Issued a generic legal denial. Locked down social media accounts. The letter apologizes and promises "investigations." |
| **Level 1** (Explainer) | Used AI to draft a PR statement explaining "Deepfakes." Promised a webinar on digital trust. The policy focuses on "security protocols." |
| **Level 2** (Storyteller) | **"Teach the conflict."** Used the moment to explain *why* digital literacy is business critical. The letter invites stakeholders to a town hall. The policy distinguishes between "malicious use" and "innovation." |
| **Level 3** (Lighthouse) | **Trust Architecture.** The response isn't about PR cleanup; it's about "Paradigm Rebuilding." The letter challenges the industry: *"We cannot ban the future. We must build organizations that are Sovereign over it."* Launches a "Vulnerability Report" for transparency. |
| **Level 4** (Sovereign) | **"Own Your Model."** The leader pivots the crisis to a conversation about "Sovereign AI." *“This happened because the content was manipulated. We are building a cryptographically signed content verification system that reflects OUR truth.”* Turned a violation into a "New Mandate" for industry leadership. |
