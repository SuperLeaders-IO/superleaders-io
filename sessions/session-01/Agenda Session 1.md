Here’s **Draft 1 of a 90-minute agenda**, written in the _language of the
experience_, not a workshop plan. This assumes:

- Zoom / Meet = video + audio
- **Meeting Twin** = Google Antigravity IDE connected to GitHub (Gemini inside)
- GitHub = live memory, not storage
- Emotional honesty > coverage
- Speed + safety > polish

This is intentionally **tight but breathable**.

# **Agentic Leadership — Session 1**

**Duration:** 90 minutes\
**Mode:** Zoom (transport) + Antigravity IDE (meeting twin) + GitHub (memory)

---

## **0–5 min — Arrival & Orientation**

**Purpose:** Set psychological safety and expectation

- Welcome
- Explicit framing:
  - This is not a course to “get right”
  - This repo will be messy on purpose
  - We are capturing _how leaders think in motion_
- Name the tools:
  - Zoom = voice
  - Antigravity = shared thinking surface
  - GitHub = where everything lands

Key line to say out loud:\
“If at any point this feels unfinished, that’s because it is.”

---

## **5–15 min — Fast Introductions: _Where You Are in This AI Moment_**

**Purpose:** Surface emotional state without letting it sprawl

**Prompt (spoken, tight):**

- Name:
  - your work / context
  - one place AI feels _challenging_
  - one place you feel like you _shine_

Rules:

- 30–45 seconds each
- No explanations
- No backstory

**Meeting Twin action (live):**

- Antigravity captures raw transcript
- No summarizing
- No cleaning
- No interpretation

This immediately differentiates the space from a webinar.

---

## **15–25 min — The Unprecedented Frame (You)**

**Purpose:** Context, not instruction

- ~15 minutes total
- Use fragments from _Unprecedented Leader_:
  - no playbook
  - collapse of time
  - conductivity over control
- No framework walkthrough
- No “and therefore you should…”

End with: “Hold your own reality up against this. See what resonates. See what
resists.”

**Meeting Twin:**

- Slides live as markdown
- Visuals generated if helpful
- Everything synced to GitHub as-is

---

## **25–45 min — Agentic Organizations (The Silent Meeting Layer)**

**Purpose:** Move from "Listening" to "Co-Processing" (80/20 Rule)

**1. The Provocation (5 min)**

- Franco drops the core thesis:
  - "AI isn't a tool; it's a new layer of agency."
  - "The org chart is dead; the network is the unit."

**2. Parallel Processing (5 min)**

- **Stop talking.**
- Everyone opens `participants/[Name]/session-01-notes.md`.
- **Prompt:** "Where is 'agency' currently blocked in your system? Name the
  blocker."
- Everyone writes simultaneously. The Repo is alive.

**3. The Harvest (10 min)**

- We read 2-3 other people's commits (via Network graph or file browse).
- Facilitator (Harvester) calls out patterns:
  - "I see [Name] and [Name] both mentioned 'Middle Management Fear'. Let's
    start there."
- Discussion is now grounded in _their_ reality, not the lecture.

---

## **45–55 min — Break Pattern: Phone Calls**

**Purpose:** Shift cognitive and emotional mode

- Randomly pair participants.
- Everyone **leaves Zoom**.
- They call each other on the phone (10 mins).

**Loose direction:**

- "Say the thing you didn't write down."

---

## **55–65 min — Return & Drop One Sentence**

**Purpose:** Capture resonance

Back in Zoom.

- Drop **one sentence** into your folder based on the call.
- "After that call, the truth I'm holding is..."

---

## **65–85 min — The Judgment Game: Hiring the Unverifiable**

**Purpose:** Practice "Epistemological Humility" & The Clarity Framework

**1. The Setup (2 min)**

- Pair up:
  - **Person A:** The Non-Technical CEO (You have a $10M budget).
  - **Person B:** The AI Architect Candidate (You are pitching a "Autonomous
    Agent Swarm").

**2. The Interview (10 min)**

- **CEO's Goal:** Do not get dazzled by jargon. Use the **Clarity Framework**
  (from `shared/concepts.md`) to test judgment.
  - _Ask:_ "Explain it like I'm 5."
  - _Ask:_ "What will go wrong?"
  - _Ask:_ "What did you choose NOT to build?"
- **Candidate's Goal:** Be convincing. (Bonus: Be slightly evasive).

**3. The Decision (8 min)**

- Stop talking.
- **CEO Action:** Commit a file to `participants/[Name]/hiring-decision.md`.
  - _Verdict:_ Hire / No Hire.
  - _Reasoning:_ "I passed on them because they couldn't explain the trade-off."
- **Candidate Action:** Commit a reflection.
  - "I felt [Name] catch me when I tried to bullshit."

**Optional:** Run the Roast Bot on the Hiring Decisions.

---

## **88–90 min — Close**

**Purpose:** Keep the door open

You close with something like: “Nothing here is finished.\
Between now and next time, feel free to ask the repo questions.\
This space will get smarter as you use it.”

No homework.\
No next steps list.

Just: “We’ve started.”

---

## **What Exists in GitHub After Session 1 (by design)**

- Full raw Zoom transcript
- Raw phone call transcripts
- Participant folders with:
  - one-sentence reflections
  - rough pillar game artifacts
  - roast bot outputs (if used)
- Slides as markdown
- No synthesis yet

This is **not a summary**.\
It’s a **dataset**.
