Here’s **Draft 1 of a 90-minute agenda**, written in the *language of the experience*, not a workshop plan. This assumes:

* Zoom / Meet \= video \+ audio

* **Meeting Twin** \= Google Antigravity IDE connected to GitHub (Gemini inside)

* GitHub \= live memory, not storage

* Emotional honesty \> coverage

* Speed \+ safety \> polish

This is intentionally **tight but breathable**.

# **Agentic Leadership — Session 1**

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
 **Mode:** Zoom (transport) \+ Antigravity IDE (meeting twin) \+ GitHub (memory)

---

## **0–5 min — Arrival & Orientation**

**Purpose:** Set psychological safety and expectation

* Welcome

* Explicit framing:

  * This is not a course to “get right”

  * This repo will be messy on purpose

  * We are capturing *how leaders think in motion*

* Name the tools:

  * Zoom \= voice

  * Antigravity \= shared thinking surface

  * GitHub \= where everything lands

Key line to say out loud:  
 “If at any point this feels unfinished, that’s because it is.”

---

## **5–15 min — Fast Introductions: *Where You Are in This AI Moment***

**Purpose:** Surface emotional state without letting it sprawl

**Prompt (spoken, tight):**

* Name:

  * your work / context

  * one place AI feels *challenging*

  * one place you feel like you *shine*

Rules:

* 30–45 seconds each

* No explanations

* No backstory

**Meeting Twin action (live):**

* Antigravity captures raw transcript

* No summarizing

* No cleaning

* No interpretation

This immediately differentiates the space from a webinar.

---

## **15–25 min — The Unprecedented Frame (You)**

**Purpose:** Context, not instruction

* \~15 minutes total

* Use fragments from *Unprecedented Leader*:

  * no playbook

  * collapse of time

  * conductivity over control

* No framework walkthrough

* No “and therefore you should…”

End with:

“Hold your own reality up against this. See what resonates. See what resists.”

**Meeting Twin:**

* Slides live as markdown

* Visuals generated if helpful

* Everything synced to GitHub as-is

---

## **25–55 min — Agentic Organizations (Franco)**

**Purpose:** Expand the horizon

* \~30 minutes

* Franco shares:

  * his vision of agentic organizations

  * how work reorganizes when AI becomes infrastructure

* This is *provocative*, not instructional

Encourage:

* disagreement

* questions

* discomfort

**Meeting Twin:**

* Full transcript captured

* No live synthesis

* No “key takeaways”

This becomes reference material later.

---

## **55–65 min — Break Pattern: Phone Calls**

**Purpose:** Shift cognitive and emotional mode

* Randomly pair participants

* Everyone **leaves Zoom**

* They call each other on the phone

* 10 minutes total

**Loose direction (not a script):**

* Where does this AI moment feel hardest right now?

* Where do you feel more capable than you expected?

* What are you holding that hasn’t had a place yet?

**Important:**

* This is voice-only

* No notes required during the call

* Just be present

---

## **65–75 min — Return & Drop One Sentence**

**Purpose:** Capture resonance, not summary

Back in Zoom.

Each participant:

* Drops **one sentence** into their GitHub folder (or shared space):

“After that call, the thing I can’t stop thinking about is \_\_\_.”

No discussion yet.  
 Just capture.

**Meeting Twin:**

* Phone call transcripts uploaded raw

* One-sentence reflections committed

This is a key memory artifact.

---

## **75–88 min — Pillar Game (Emotion-First, Paired)**

**Purpose:** Self-diagnostic through play

* Re-pair participants (can be same or different)

* Each pair gets **one pillar scenario**

* Time-boxed, low stakes

Framing:

* Zero evaluation

* No polish

* Notice what shows up emotionally

They work inside:

* Antigravity IDE

* Their own GitHub folders

They capture:

* what they did first

* what felt hardest

* what they avoided

**Optional:**  
 Run the friendly roast bot on their rough output.

Laughter is a feature.

---

## **88–90 min — Close**

**Purpose:** Keep the door open

You close with something like:

“Nothing here is finished.  
 Between now and next time, feel free to ask the repo questions.  
 This space will get smarter as you use it.”

No homework.  
 No next steps list.

Just:

“We’ve started.”

---

## **What Exists in GitHub After Session 1 (by design)**

* Full raw Zoom transcript

* Raw phone call transcripts

* Participant folders with:

  * one-sentence reflections

  * rough pillar game artifacts

  * roast bot outputs (if used)

* Slides as markdown

* No synthesis yet

This is **not a summary**.  
 It’s a **dataset**.
