# Agentic Leadership — A Living Repository

This repository is the course.

Not a portal.
Not an LMS.
Not a collection of readings.

It is a **shared, living workspace** where a cohort of leaders is actively thinking, talking, building, and reflecting together during an unprecedented AI moment.

If you’re looking for a polished curriculum, you won’t find one.
If you’re looking for real leadership in motion, you’re in the right place.

## What This Is

This repo is:
- a shared memory of live conversations
- a working archive of unfinished ideas
- a place where AI is used *with* leaders, not *on* them
- a surface you can query, remix, and build from

Everything here exists so that leadership doesn’t disappear when the meeting ends.

Video is ephemeral.
This repo is persistent.

---

## How This Works

Our live sessions happen over Zoom / Google Meet.

Alongside those sessions, we use a **Meeting Twin**:
an IDE connected directly to this GitHub repository, with AI embedded.

That means:
- raw transcripts are captured
- notes, slides, and artifacts are created live
- participants can write directly into the repo
- AI can reason over the actual material of the cohort

GitHub is not storage here.
GitHub is the **thinking substrate**.

---

## What You’ll See Inside

This repository will grow unevenly over time.

You will find:
- full, raw transcripts from live sessions
- transcripts from paired phone conversations
- slide decks written in Markdown
- facilitator notes and fragments
- demos, sketches, and half-built tools
- participant-submitted work
- shared language as it emerges

Nothing is cleaned up by default.
Nothing is summarized for you.
Meaning is something we *pull*, not something we’re given.

## Structure (Intentionally Minimal)

sessions/ → records of live time (notes, transcripts, slides, artifacts)
participants/ → one working folder per participant
shared/ → material that keeps resurfacing across sessions

yaml
Copy code

This structure is light on purpose.
If patterns emerge, we’ll structure later.

---

## Participant Ownership

Each participant has their own folder.

Use it however you want:
- notes
- reflections
- drafts
- screenshots
- prompts
- things you’re not sure about yet

Some participants may also fork this repo to their own GitHub accounts
to work with sensitive or internal material privately.

That’s encouraged.

This space is about **agency**, not compliance.

---

## Using AI With This Repo

As this repository grows, you should be able to ask questions like:
- “Given what’s in our sessions, what could I try in my organization right now?”
- “What patterns show up in how I respond under pressure?”
- “Who else wrestled with something similar?”
- “What ideas keep resurfacing?”

The answers should come from *this corpus*:
our conversations, our work, our uncertainty.

Not generic advice.

---

## What This Is Not

This is not:
- a certification
- a framework library
- a best-practices guide
- a polished knowledge base
- a Google Drive replacement

If it ever feels like one of those, we’ve missed the point.

---

## One Guiding Principle

If something represents:
- real thinking
- real conversation
- real uncertainty
- real work in progress

It belongs here.

Everything else is negotiable.

---

## A Final Note

This repository is meant to feel unfinished.
It should change every session.
It should surprise you.

If you’re unsure where to start:
open the most recent session folder,
or your own participant folder,
and add something honest.

That’s enough.
