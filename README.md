That’s it.
No extra ceremony.

sessions/

Where lived time gets captured

Each session gets a folder.
Nothing inside is required — only expected.

sessions/
  session-01/
  session-02/
  session-03/
  session-04/


Inside a session folder, files may include (not guaranteed):

session-01/
  transcript.md          ← raw full-group transcript
  phone-calls/           ← raw paired call transcripts
  slides.md              ← markdown slide deck
  notes.md               ← live / facilitator notes
  artifacts/             ← demos, visuals, outputs


Rules:

transcripts are raw

nothing is cleaned

nothing is summarized by default

artifacts can be messy

order doesn’t matter

Sessions are records, not lessons.

participants/

Where individual thinking lives

Each participant has a folder.

participants/
  alice/
  bob/
  charlie/


Inside, anything goes:

participants/alice/
  notes.md
  pillar-game.md
  screenshots/
  drafts/
  prompts.md


Rules:

no formatting expectations

no evaluation

no “right” way

public by default, unless someone chooses otherwise

These folders are personal working memory.

shared/

Things that cut across sessions

This is for material that keeps resurfacing.

shared/
  references.md      ← links, articles, videos
  concepts.md        ← words, phrases, language that emerges
  datasets/           ← any data we reuse
  demos/              ← shared experiments or tools


Rules:

nothing here is authoritative

this is a commons, not a canon

duplication is fine

If something shows up more than once, it probably belongs here.

What We Are Not Doing (On Purpose)

No rigid templates

No deep nesting

No tagging systems (yet)

No enforced naming conventions

No summaries replacing raw material

If we need structure later, we’ll add it after patterns emerge.

How This Stays Queryable

This structure works because:

files are small and human-readable

transcripts are intact

authorship is visible

history is preserved

AI can reason across folders without needing schemas

We optimize for search, recall, and pattern detection, not cleanliness.

The Only Rule That Matters

If a file represents:

real thinking

real conversation

real uncertainty

real work in progress

It belongs in this repo.

Everything else is negotiable.
