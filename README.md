# Agentic Leadership — A SuperLeaders Living Repository

> "Technical skill is the bottleneck. Judgment is the scarce resource."

This repository is not a course. It is a shared thinking substrate for leaders
navigating the AI transition.

## The Philosophy

We are moving from an era of scarcity (syntax) to an era of abundance
(generation). In this new reality, leadership is not about managing compliance;
it is about exercising **judgment**.

This repository reflects that shift.

- **It is not static.** It evolves as we think.
- **It is not polished.** It captures raw, messy, high-stakes thinking.
- **It is not a silo.** It is a collective memory for the cohort.

## What Lives Here

1. **Session Records (`sessions/`)**: The raw material of our time together.
   Transcripts, agendas, and artifacts from the Meeting Twin.
2. **Participant Work (`participants/`)**: Your individual workspace. A place to
   draft, reflect, and store your own intellectual property.
3. **Shared Intelligence (`shared/`)**: Frameworks, prompts, and tools that
   belong to the collective.

## Operating Protocols (How to Use This)

You do not need to be a developer to extract value from this codebase.

### 1. Navigation

- **To see what happened:** Go to `sessions/`.
- **To do your work:** Go to `participants/[YourInitials]`.

### 2. Contribution

- We do not "submit homework." We **drop artifacts**.
- If you have an idea, a draft, or a reflection, put it in your folder.
- The system (and the cohort) will use it to build context.

### 3. The Question Buckets

Every session has a `questions/` folder with three buckets:

1. **Before:** "Open Loops" (What you're bringing in).
2. **During:** "Parking Lot" (What comes up live).
3. **After:** "The Retro" (What stuck). Use these to log your state of mind.

### 4. What if I break something?

You can't. History is saved forever. If you delete the whole thing by accident,
we can just undo it. **Be fearless.**

## One Rule

If it represents **real thinking**—uncertainty, strategy, judgment—it belongs
here. Everything else is noise.
